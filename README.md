Nene Valley Basketball Club is a real sports club based in Peterborough, UK. The club has been a big part of the local basketball scene for many years and provides training for both junior and senior players. Having spoken to the owner and head coach of the club, I was kindly given permission to create a new website for them that would be functional for existing members, whilst also reamining accessible and eye-catching to new potential players.
