<h1 align="center"> :basketball: Nene Valley Basketball Club Website :basketball: </h1>

Nene Valley Basketball Club is a real sports club based in Peterborough, UK. The club has been a big part of the local basketball scene for many years and provides training for both junior and senior players. Having spoken to the owner and head coach of the club, I was kindly given permission to create a new website for them that would be functional for existing members, whilst also remaining accessible and eye-catching to new potential players.

## Purpose

The purpose of the website is two-fold:

### 1 - Existing players
To provide an easily acessible space for existing players to engage with their club; allowing quick access to contact details and relevant, live training/fixtures information

### 2 - New players
To provide an engaging and appealing space to prospective players, encouraging them to make contact with the club and attend a training session. They need to get a clear sense of brand identity, club ethos, and quickly access a method of communication.
