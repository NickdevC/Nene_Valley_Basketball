[View the live project here](http://nickdevc.github.io/Nene_Valley_Basketball/)

Nene Valley Basketball Club is a real sports club based in Peterborough, UK. The club has been a big part of the local basketball scene for many years and provides training for both junior and senior players. Having spoken to the owner and head coach of the club, I was kindly given permission to create a new website for them that would be functional for existing members, whilst also remaining accessible and eye-catching to new potential players.

## Purpose

The purpose of the website is two-fold:

### 1 - Existing players
To provide an easily acessible space for existing players to engage with their club; allowing quick access to contact details and relevant, live training/fixtures information

### 2 - New players
To provide an engaging and appealing space to prospective players, encouraging them to make contact with the club and attend a training session. They need to get a clear sense of brand identity, club ethos, and quickly access a method of communication.

## Features

   ### Existing Features
      
-   __Navigation Bar__

    - The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement on all three pages of the website supporting easy navigation.  It includes a simple Logo, Home page, Fixtures and Training, and Contact links and is responsive on multiple screen sizes.  On medium sized screens (smaller laptops or ipads), the navigation menu moves to under the logo. On small screen sizes (mobile phones), the logo is abbreviated to ensure legibility, accessibility and effective use of space.

-   __Home page - Hero image and call to action__

    - The landing page consists of a large, iconic hero image, an overlaying inspiration quote, and a button that sends the user to the contacts page.
    - The image is instantly recognisable, identifying the focus of the website, whilst also conveying a sense of action with the slight zoom animation when the page is loaded by the user.
    - The overlaying text is designed to engage with users by encouraging them to consider one of the key ethos of the club: teamwork. The text section has been designed to be legible and accessible on all devices with responsive designs in place.
    - In addition to this, the button (which links directly to the Contact Us page) then encourages the user to make contact and engage directly with the club by opening communication channels (signing up new members is one of the fundamental purposes of the website).

      ![Navbar](documentation/supporting_images/NVV_landing.jpg)
      
-   __Home page - Tagline__

    - In order to seperate the hero image from the additional 'about' section, I decided to include a tagline to establish the club's prominant position in the local area. It includes an established date and the location.
    - The tagline is bold, with no additional imagery that could otherwise distract the user from firm message being conveyed.  

      ![Navbar](documentation/supporting_images/NVV_tagline.jpg)
      
-   __Home page - About section__

    - The about section is designed to give first or returning users the chance to get a basic understanding or 'flavour' of the club.
    - Three action-driven images help to give the home page more life and vibrancy whilst acting as a window into what the club's day-to-day experience may look like for the user.
    - Three columns of text act to give the user more specific, detailed information about the clubs structure and their achievements (setting them apart from other competing institutions)
    - This section has been designed to be repsonsive, switching to a row structure on smaller screen sizes.

      ![Navbar](documentation/supporting_images/NVV_about_text.jpg)

-   __Footer__

    - The footer provides the user with access to four social media links (currently the basketball club only has an active presence on Facebook). These allow users to easily connect with the clubs current trending information, communicate with other players/like-minded people, share their thoughts and engage in recent media. 

      ![Navbar](documentation/supporting_images/NVV_footer.jpg)
      
-   __Fixtures & Training page - Fixtures calendar__

    - One of the core purposes of the website is for current players to be able to access current fixtures information during their training season. These users will regularly be returning to the site and therfore need this information to be easily accessible and easy to navigate. 
    - I decided to use a table to display this information as columns provided me with clear, seperated spaces for key data. 
    - There is also some feedback generated for the user in the form of a highlight that applies to a row when the user hovers their pointer over it. This ensures the user can pinpoint a specific row and easily record information that could otherwise be lost in the table. 
    - The table itself is also responsive and, when displayed on small screens, will provide a scroll bar so that font-size remains legible whilst not compromising on it's prupose or aesthetics.

-   __FIxtures & Training page - Training schedule__

    - For first time, or new users, the club training times are simple yet important pieces of information. For this reason, they are displayed in large bold containers at the bottom of the page.

      ![Navbar](documentation/supporting_images/NVV_training.jpg)
      
-   __Contact Us page__

    - The contact form on this page is designed to allow users to begin a dialogue with the club and share some of their contact information. For new/potential players, they can easily ask questions, using the text area box, that are personal to their needs, whilst existing players can leave less pressing or urgent communication with their coach.
    - I also included radio buttons which not only allow the organisation to categorise queries, but also provides an opportunity to collect important data regarding usage. In the future, the club could use this information to reveal which type of user makes up the majority of internet traffic on the site and make changes in light of this to boost further traffic.
